						<h3 class="indent">My experience developing applications for the Android system was started in 2010 shortly after I purchased my first smartphone. I have always loved getting my hands dirty creating parts for my cars, doing general maintenance, replacing transmissions, or taking engines apart for performance optimizations. So, conceivably, I had an idea to create "Car Maintenance and Fuel". I researched the Android market for simular apps with no prevail of anything worthy of a download. This is when everything started. I still remember the first Android tutorial I ever watched "The New Boston", little did I know it would spark an interest for a new carrer.</h3><br><h3 class="indent">I quickly became immersed with learning java and spent most nights after working as a waiter consumed with my project. Quickly, I put forth well over a thousand hours of effort into learning, developing, and perfecting my vission until it became a reality. I finally had a product I believed to be worthy of not only Android consumer standards, but my standards aswell. Car Maintenance &amp; Fuel (Easy) was released to the world and now I could only anxiously wait for the reviews and downloads to flow in. For the first couple months I watch my downloads grow and quickly pass the 10,000 mark. Reviews were generally good and I had a 4.5 out of 5 for the first half a year. As users used it more and more they had questions, complaints, ideas, you name it... So, while I was developing the paid version "Car Maintenance &amp; Fuel (Pro)" I also made many updates for the free version, optimizing it for my users.</h3><br><h3 class="indent">The paid version was released months after the initial release of the free application and I started getting downloads at a charge of $0.99. I quickly raised the price to $3.49 a download after realizing there were no problems transfering users data. Downloads after a year were over 1,000 for the paid version while I was also making some money from adds on the free version which had reached about 50,000 downloads.</h3><br><h3 class="indent">My next project was creating a series of sports widgets, ranging from baseball, soccer, football, basketball, and even nascar. My plan was to create a source code for all of these widgets and be able to replicate them quickly and effortlessly. My widget idea was to create a unique eye catching logo/icon for each widget and include information for each player such as stats, biography, schedule etc... I finished the source code in a couple days and quickly started making widgets for all the most popular sports players. After a little work i had about fifteen widgets out on Google Play and was making about $2,000 a month in passive income.</h3><br><h3 class="indent">I used Google Analytics for optimization while experimenting with every Android add company out there until I gained a sense of overall optimazation. I have worked with add companys such as Admob, Adsense, Tap Context, App Next, and a few others that were very short lived. I ended up optimizing my widgets to an average CPC. of $0.21, RPM. of $3.84, and CTR. of 1.83% while maintaining an average rating of 4.5 out of 5. Things were on there way up and I was pondering my next business idea.</h3>
