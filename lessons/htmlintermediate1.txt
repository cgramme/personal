<h2 id="current-lesson">HTML lesson 1 - Line breaks</h2>
			<h4 class="indent">By now you should be familiar with headings &lt;h1> and paragraphs &lt;p>, these tags do not respect whitespace. Whitespace is empty space within your content. Most tags only respect single spaces between words, any extra spaces will be displayed as a single space. additionally, line breaks are not respected either so we need the the line break tag &lt;br>. Line breaks do not need closing tags. Place the &lt;br> tag anywhere in your text where a line break is necessary. Click on the code below to see how it works.</h4>
			<h4 class="code">&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;html>
&lt;head>
&lt;/head>
&lt;body>
  &lt;h1>To use line breaks in HTML you will need the &lt;br> tag to skip to the next line.&lt;/h1>
&lt;/body>
&lt;/html></h4>
