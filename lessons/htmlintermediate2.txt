<h2 id="current-lesson">HTML lesson 2 - Pre tag</h2>
			<h4 class="indent">In the last lesson we talked about the use of line breaks. Almost all HTML doesn't respect whitespace within the content, this is where the &lt;pre> tag comes into play. Any content included within the &lt;pre>....&lt;/pre> will be displayed as it is written in the tag. This is a very useful tag for displaying code. Click the code below for an example.</h4>
			<h4 class="code">&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;html>
&lt;head>
&lt;/head>
&lt;body>
  &lt;pre>The pre tag is great for working with spaces     line breaks,

or any formatting of text you would like.&lt;/pre>
&lt;/body>
&lt;/html></h4>
