<h2 id="current-lesson">HTML lesson 2 - HTML tags</h2>
			<h4 class="indent">Now that you have an idea of what a basic HTML document looks like let's go over some HTML tags.<br>Remember the basic structure of a tag &lt;tagname>the content of the tag&lt;/tagname>.<br>Tags are always opened with the tag surrounded by less than and greater than symbols &lt;tag&gt;.<br>Now that we know how to open a tag we need to close it. Tags are closed in a very similar fashion as opening them. &lt/tag&gt;. Below is an example of a title tag which will display any content entered in the tab at the top of the page, just like "Code Odyssey" is displayed on this page.</h4>
			<h4 class="code">&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;html>
&lt;head>
  &lt;title>My Awesome Page Title&lt;/title>	<----This is the title tag
&lt;/head>
&lt;body>
Hello World
&lt;/body>
&lt;/html></h4>
