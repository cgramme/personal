								<h2>Code Odyssey</h2>
								<p class="indent">Code Odyssey is a website I created to teach aspiring web-developers basic web technologies, tips, tricks, and some intermediate to advanced coding practices. My inspiration for creating the site was to give young and intermediate developers a free place to either learn on a step by step system, or simply to use it as a handy reference. Code Odyssey is a work in progress with much room to grow into the full potential I have planned for its future updates.</p>

								<h2>Car Maintenance and Fuel</h2>
								<p class="indent">This is an Android application I created years back as my first coding project and is the reason I fell in love with programming altogether. I simply had an idea which I thought would be successful and went through the procceses of learning how to code as I created it. This is one of the biggest challenges and accomplishments I have encountered on my coding journey so far. Going from knowing basic coding to producing a polished Android product, then creating a "Pro" version was a challenge I loved and never gave up on. The free version reached just under 50,000 downloads in the first two years while the pro version reached 1000 downloads in a year at $3.49. It may not have been a retirement project, but it was certainly an enjoyable and gratifying process.</p>
								<p class="indent">I have improved my coding ability over the past few years quite a bit and have plans to recreate a similar, even more polished version of this app for both the Iphone and Android systems. Even though I consider 'Car Maintenance and Fuel' to be a success I see many ways to improve the code and functionality.</p>

								<h2>Intergalactic Adventures INC.</h2>
								<p class="indent">Intergalactic Adventures INC. is a fictional business I created to be fun and comical. It makes light of businesses we may very well see in the distant future and lets you book a "faux" vacation to various intergalactic destinations. I have always been intrigued by the vastsness of space, thus creating this was one way of channeling my creativity and interest to a new level. This website is also responsive to all devices and screen sizes. Enjoy, and have a safe flight!</p>

								<h2>Our Home "The Solar System"</h2>
								<p class="indent">I created this website to be interactive and provide informative facts regarding our home, the solar system. The key was to provide information about the sun and each planet in our solar system, while personally having fun with CSS techniques. As with almost all my websites I created this to be responsive to all devices and screen sizes.</p>

								<h2>Dreamsite Reality</h2>
								<p class="indent">Dreamsite Reality is an example layout I created for practice working with Bootstrap technologies. The idea of Dreamsite Reality is a website developing business where customers can look at a few example layouts and get a feel for which styles I can deliver for their site. This is a business idea I will invest more time on in the future.</p>
