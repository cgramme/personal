								<h2>Code Odyssey</h2>
								<p class="indent">Code Odyssey is a website I created to teach aspiring web-developers basic web technologies, tips, tricks, and some intermediate to advanced coding practices. My inspiration for creating the site was to give young and intermedite developers a free place to either learn on a step by step system, or simply to use it as a handy reference. Code Odyssey is a work in progress with much room to grow into the full potential I have planned for its future updates.</p>

								<h2>Car Maintenance and Fuel</h2>
								<p class="indent">This is an Android application I created years back as my first coding project and is the reason I fell in love with programming altogether. I simply had an idea which I thought would be succesful and went through the procceses of learning how to code as I created it. This is one of the biggest challenges and accomplishments I have encountered on my coding journey so far. Going from not knowing anything about coding to producing a polished Android product and then creating a "Pro" version was a challenge I loved and never gave up on. The free version reached just under 50,000 downloads in the first two years and the pro version reaching 1000 downloads in a year at $3.49. It may not have been a retirement project, but it was certainly an enjoyable and gratifying procces.</p>
								<p class="indent">I have improved my ability to code over the past few year quite a bit and have plans to rerelease a simular even more polished version of this app for both Iphone and Android systems. Even though I consider Car Maintenance and Fuel to be a success I see many ways to improve the code and functionality, starting on a blank slate.</p>

								<h2>Dreamsite Reality</h2>
								<p class="indent">Dreamsite Reality is a example layout I created for practice working with Bootstrap technologies. The idea of Dreamsite Reality is a website developing business where customers can look at a few example layouts and get a feel for which styles I can deliver for thier own site. This is a business idea I will invest more time on in the future.</p>
